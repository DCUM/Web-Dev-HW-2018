    <p>The year that Buttercup was born, the most beautiful woman in the world was a French scullery maid named Annette.<br>
    Annette worked in Paris for the Duke and Duchess de Guiche, and it did not escape the Duke's notice that someone<br>
    extraordinary was polishing the pewter. The Duke's notice did not escape the notice of the Duchess either, who was<br>
    not very beautiful and not very rich, but plenty smart. The Duchess set about studying Annette and shortly found her<br>
    adversary's tragic flaw.<br>
    Chocolate.</p>
    <p>Armed now, the Duchess set to work. The Palace de Guiche turned into a candy castle.<br>
    Everywhere you looked, bonbons. There were piles of chocolate-covered mints in the drawing rooms, baskets of chocolate-<br>
    covered nougats in the parlors. Annette never had a chance. Inside a season, she went from delicate to whopping, and the <br>
    Duke never glanced in her direction without sad bewilderment clouding his eyes. (Annette, it might be noted, seemed only <br>
    cheerier throughout her enlargement. She eventually married the pastry chef and they both ate a lot until old age claimed <br>
    them. </p>
    <p>Things, it might also be noted, did not fare so cheerily for the Duchess. The Duke, for reasons passing understanding, next <br>
    became smitten with his very own mother-in-law, which caused the Duchess ulcers, only they didn't have ulcers yet.<br>
    More precisely, ulcers existed, people had them, but they weren't called "ulcers." The medical profession at that time called<br>
    them "stomach pains" and felt the best cure was coffee dolloped with brandy twice a day until the pains subsided.<br>
    The Duchess took her mixture faithfully, watching through the years as her husband and her mother blew kisses at each other<br>
    behind her back. Not surprisingly, the Duchess's grumpiness became legendary, as Voltaire has so ably chronicled. <br>
    (Except this was before Voltaire.)</p>
    <p>The year Buttercup turned ten, the most beautiful woman lived in Bengal, the daughter<br>
    of a successful tea merchant. This girl's name was Aluthra, and her skin was of a dusky perfection unseen in India for eighty<br>
    years. (There have only been eleven perfect complexions in all of India since accurate accounting began.) Aluthra was nineteen<br>
    the year the pox plague hit Bengal. The girl survived, even if her skin did not. When Buttercup was fifteen, Adela Terrell,<br>
    of Sussex on the Thames, was easily the most beautiful creature. Adela was twenty, and so far did she outdistance the world<br>
    that it seemed certain she would be the most beautiful for many, many years. But then one day, one of her suitors (she had 104 of them)<br>
    exclaimed that without question Adela must be the most ideal item yet spawned. Adela, flattered, began to ponder on the truth<br>
    of the statement. That night, alone in her room, she examined herself pore by pore in her mirror. (This was after mirrors.)<br>
    It took her until close to dawn to finish her inspection, but by that time it was clear to her that the young man had been<br>
    quite correct in his assessment: she was, through no real fault of her own, perfect.</p>
