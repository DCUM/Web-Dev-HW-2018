# Typography

##
I chose two JosefinSlab and Handlee. Two fonts that I thought complemented eachother quite well
and fit into the style of the "Princess Bride" without either being too fancy or cursive to be
legible.

A system font is one that's downloaded onto your computer, while a web font is one that's sourcd from
a website. A web-safe font is somewhat like a hybrid between the two, where it uses fonts that are hosted
on your computer, just in case the web hosted font won't render.
The importance of having fallback fonts is that there are many cases where the desired font doesn't
work. In these cases it's better to have a font that isn't too jarring and unlike the chosen font to
replace it.

Knowing I only had one evening to complete this assignment in order to pass, I got home from work and started
working on it by about 4. I set up the basics of the index page and after reviewing the readme's, I decided to
go with the princess bride. I chose some overly decorative fonts at first, but changed my mind and went more
simple because I had trouble reading them. I formatted the headings and text and then uploaded my text files.
I didn't have much of a problem using the JosefinSlab, but struggled to use a different method to use the Handlee.
My color choices seemed easy, I basically went with my sisters old bedroom colors. I added the read more link at the
end, but even though I tried to swtich it to several different web pages that promised you could read princess bride,
they all lead to error pages, because I don't think you legally can unless you buy it. Anyway, I used a pseudo-element
to make the link change colors when you hover and stuff.
