<p>A page can contain more than one head element, although it's unnescessary. It can hold lots of info inside of it, such as titles, links, etc. In Html 5, you don't even need a head element.<br>
A page can only contain one body element. It stores the "body" or most of the written information on a page.<br>
</p>
<p>Semantic markup is based on choosing tags according to what they mean, while structural markup is all about following the outline of the page.</p>
<p>My work cycle for this assignment was just sitting down for 5 straight hours and figuring it out. HTML somewhat makes sense to me, but I kept checking to make sure that the webpage was displaying all of the changes I was doing. I struggled with sourcing the photo and with some of the links, but I believe that it's all done correctly except for the damn picture.</p>
