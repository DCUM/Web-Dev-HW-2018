# Assignment 8-The tightest Vacuum in the world

## Technical Report

### What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
<p>Padding is the space inside the border, margins are the outer space and are next to other elements and borders<br>
are in between the padding and the margins. So if there was an image in the element, it would be located in the padding<br>
with the border on the outer edges of it and the margins outside of it.

#### What was the hardest task for you to accomplish this assignment? For example, was it overlapping elements, working with muliple fonts, creating layout, or something else entriely?
<p>Working with the images was initially the most difficult thing for me after I finally got my style sheet to work.<br>
We've worked with images in the past, but never overlapping them and whatnot. But once I got the formula down it just took<br>
some adjustments. Ultimately, the fonts are what gave me the most trouble since this is my very first time working with<br>
them in coding format. While everything else looked nearly just right, the fonts are still a bit off for me.

##### Summarize your work cycle for this assignment. Review this page if you need some ideas.
<p>Downloaded the materials, set up a basic format and then struggled super hard to get the images positioned and<br>
sized correctly. But I believe they are for the most part, other than a little overlap and crowding.<br>
I struggled to get my style sheet to work, partially because I had originally named it "stylesheet" instead of "style"<br>
so naturally, it wasn't linking correctly. After I figured that out, I managed to give the document its proper(ish) form.<br>
I made a fonts.css page and tried to match the available fonts to the provided original ad. I think I did an alright job,<br>
but like I said, it's not perfect.
