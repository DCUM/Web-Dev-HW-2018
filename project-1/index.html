<h2>Desiderata</h2>
<h3>By: Max Ehrmann</h3>
<body>
Go placidly amid the noise and haste, <br>
and remember what peace there may be in silence. <br>
As far as possible without surrender <br>
be on good terms with all persons.<br>
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;<br>
and listen to others,<br>
even the dull and the ignorant;<br>
they too have their story.<br>
