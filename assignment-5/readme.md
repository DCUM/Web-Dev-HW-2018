## Technical Report

###  Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
Divs and spans are both used to group chunks of HTML, but spans are used to group<br>
small amounts of code inside a line, while divd are block-line and can group larger data sets.</br>
An ID is used to classify one element, while class is used to classify more than one. <br>

#### Why might I consider third-party over self-hosted media?
Self-hosted data is owned by you, so you won't get sued over it and you have creative control.<br>
Third-party hosted data is like videos on youtube. You don't own the data, but you don't have to worry <br>
about bandwith or file sizes. <br>

###### Summarize your work cycle.
Chose "Instant Crush" by Daft Punk. Decided to keep the design black and white and very simple. cancelled out <br>
border element because it just didn't look good. Found a great image of the guys that's a polaroid with a transparent <br>
background, so it just sits there like a polaroid. Decided to use Spotify as the media streaming agent, because <br>
I happen to have an account because of KBGA. Worked great, immediately. Adjusted the size. Addd a youtube video, but <br>
had to re-do it and add a Vevo video because they own the rights, so the youtube wouldn't show. Adjusted the size. <br>
messed with the fonts, ended up re-doing the head elements after the text kept getting wonkier and wonkier as I went <br>
Eventually went with Courier and Impact. All black. I added the UM info, but was horrified to see the text turn into <br>
Impact font, so I went in and changed it to a reasonably sized courier and made the blue box around it invisible <br>
because it looked tacky with my set-up. Lastly, I got creative and hid a little dedication easter egg on the bottom <br>
to my friend who loves this song. The font's white and so is the bg, so it's hidden unless hi-lighted. <br>
