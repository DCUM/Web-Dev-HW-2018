<h3>Lyrics:</h3>
<p>
I didn't want to be the one to forget <br>
I thought of everything I'd never regret <br>
Let's run with it because it's all we can take <br>
One thing I'd never see, the same way around <br>
I don't believe it and it slips from the ground <br>
I want to take you to that place near the rush <br>
But no one gives us any time anymore <br>
He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog <br>
You made an offer for it, then you ran off <br>
I got this picture of us kissin' in my head <br>
And all I hear is the last thing that you said <br>
</p>
<p>
Listen to you brother, and listen to me <br>
I didn't want to anymore <br>
And we will never be alone again <br>
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday <br>
Kinda counted on you being a friend <br>
Kinda given up on giving away <br>
Now I thought about what I wanna say <br>
But I never really know where to go <br>
So I chained myself to a friend <br>
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go <br>
</p>
<p>
And we will never be alone again <br>
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday <br>
Kinda counted on you being a friend <br>
Kinda given up on giving away <br>
Now I thought about what I wanna say <br>
But I never really know where to go <br>
So I chained myself to a friend <br>
Some more again <br>
<p>
It didn't matter what they wanted to see <br>
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me <br>
I saw my memory that just never dies <br>
We worked too long and hard to give it no time <br>
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies <br>
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise <br>
He runs the scissors at the seam in the wall <br>
He cannot break it down or else he would fall <br>
One thousand lonely stars <br>
Hiding in the cold <br>
Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore <br>
</p>
<p>
Listen to you brother, and listen to me <br>
I didn't want to anymore <br>
And we will never be alone again <br>
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday <br>
Kinda counted on you being a friend <br>
Kinda given up on giving away <br>
Now I thought about what I wanna say <br>
But I never really know where to go <br>
So I chained myself to a friend <br>
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go <br>
</p>
<p>
And we will never be alone again <br>
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday <br>
Kinda counted on you being a friend <br>
Kinda given up on giving away <br>
Now I thought about what I wanna say <br>
But I never really know where to go <br>
So I chained myself to a friend <br>
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go <br>
I don't wanna start, don't get upset <br>
I'm not with you <br>
It's all I do when I'm with you <br>
</p>
<p>
And we will never be alone again <br>
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday <br>
Kinda counted on you being a friend <br>
Kinda given up on giving away <br>
Now I thought about what I wanna say <br>
But I never really know where to go <br>
So I chained myself to a friend <br>
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go <br>
And we will never be alone again <br>
'Cause it doesn't happen everyday <br>
Kinda counted on you being a friend <br>
Kinda given up on giving away <br>
Now I thought about what I wanna say <br>
But I never really know where to go <br>
So I chained myself to a friend <br>
'Cause there's nowhere else I could go <br>
