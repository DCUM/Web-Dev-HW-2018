# Assignment 2

A Version Control System allows you to keep multiple copies of code, but only shows you a single version at a time. This is particularly helpful when dealing with code in our class because we can work with multiple files without changing or deleting work from our final file.

-The work I did this cycle finally helped me connect the links in my brain to figure out how all of the components of this class link together. I don't feel like I made too many personal choices for this other than the actual text itself. Just tried to follow the instructions.
-I had some, but having failed this class last semester I was able to identify the pitfalls that killed me. Nic, one of the TA's and my coworker helped me clean up the mess I had made of Atom/github last semester so I could set-up correctly.
-The interconnectedness of the programs and the github website. I think I get it, but I had to sit down and write out a super dumbed down list of steps to get stuff to the website correctly
-Not this time, my problems from last semester ran too deep so I just bothered Nic. In the future, I will be more active on the boards now that I at least know what's going on.
